# (2015) Distributed traffic regulation for congestion avoidance using vehicle-to-vehicle(V2V) communication

This is a part of veins project (http://veins.car2x.org/) that combines Sumo (http://www.dlr.de/ts/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-9883/16931_read-41000/) and Omnet++ (https://omnetpp.org/) simulators for Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication projects. We used this project to develop a distributed algorithm for traffic regulation and investigate the impact in time travel, distance and CO2 emission.
